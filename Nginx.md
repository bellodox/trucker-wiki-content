This quickstart will get you going with hosting static HTML sites on Trucker.io using Nginx.

## Local workstation setup<a name="local-workstation-setup-2"></a>

[Install Trucker Command Line Tool](Getting-Started#install-trucker-command-line-tool) on your local workstation. This ensures that you have access to the Trucker command-line client, Foreman, and the Git revision control system.
Once installed, youâ€™ll have access to the trucker command from your command shell. Log in using the email address and password you used when creating your Trucker account:

```
$ truck login
email>
password>
```

## Custom configuration files

You can customise the configuration by adding a `nginx.conf` to your root folder.

If the buildpack detects this file it will be used in place of the built-in `nginx.conf`, and run through the
same erb processor.  An example of the most basic `nginx.conf` (this is the one included in the build pack's `conf` directory):

```
worker_processes 1;
daemon off;

error_log <%= ENV["APP_ROOT"] %>/nginx/logs/error.log;
events { worker_connections 1024; }

http {
  log_format trucker '$http_x_forwarded_for - $http_referer - [$time_local] "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent';
  access_log <%= ENV["APP_ROOT"] %>/nginx/logs/access.log cloud foundry;
  default_type application/octet-stream;
  include mime.types;
  sendfile on;
  gzip on;
  tcp_nopush on;
  keepalive_timeout 30;

  server {
    listen <%= ENV["PORT"] %>;
    server_name localhost;

    location ~ /\.ht { deny  all; }
    location / {
      root <%= ENV["APP_ROOT"] %>/public;
      index index.html index.htm Default.htm;
    }
  }
}
```

## Deploy your application to Trucker<a name="deploy-your-application-to-trucker-2"></a>

**Push the application to Trucker.io**

It's important to include the `--buildpack` after the `push` command, to use static HTML hosting on Trucker.io using Nginx.

First perform a push command and enter your desired application name.

```
$ truck push --buildpack https://github.com/trucker/nginx-buildpack.git
Name> trucker-test

Instances> 1

1: 128M
2: 256M
3: 512M
4: 1G
Memory Limit> 256M

Creating trucker-test... OK

1: trucker-test
2: none
Subdomain> trucker-test

1: trucker.io
2: none
Domain> trucker.io

Creating route trucker-test.trucker.io... OK
Binding trucker-test.trucker.io to trucker-test... OK
```

**Deployment**

You app will now be deployed, the output should look something like this:

```
Creating trucker-test... OK

Binding trucker-test.trucker.io to trucker-test... OK
Uploading trucker-test... OK
Preparing to start trucker-test... OK
-----> Downloaded app package (360K)
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/buildpacks/nginx-buildpack.git/.git/
-----> Doing work with nginx-1.4.1 son.
-----> Ensuring manifest.yml & stackato.yml aren't availble in public/
-----> Uploading droplet (1.3M)
Checking status of app 'trucker-test'....
  1 of 1 instances running (1 running)
Push successful! App 'trucker-test' available at trucker-test.trucker.io
```

You application is now available at http://trucker-test.trucker.io

## Example manifest file

This how your `manifest.yml` could look like.
